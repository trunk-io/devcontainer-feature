# Dev Container Features: Self Authoring Template

Devcontainers feature for the Trunk CLI tool:

> This repo defines a custom [dev container Feature](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/),
> hosted for free on GitHub Container Registry. It follows the
> [dev container Feature distribution specification](https://containers.dev/implementors/features-distribution/).

## Contents

### `trunk`

Running `trunk` inside the built container will print the greeting provided to it via its `greeting`
option.

```jsonc
{
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/trunk-io/devcontainer-feature/trunk:1": {}
  }
}
```

```bash
$ trunk

usage
  trunk [flags] [subcommand]
  ...
```

## Repo and Feature Structure

Similar to the [`devcontainers/features`](https://github.com/devcontainers/features) repo, this
repository has a `src` folder. Each Feature has its own sub-folder, containing at least a
`devcontainer-feature.json` and an entrypoint script `install.sh`.

```
├── src
│   ├── trunk
│   │   ├── devcontainer-feature.json
│   │   └── install.sh
|   ├── ...
│   │   ├── devcontainer-feature.json
│   │   └── install.sh
...
```

An [implementing tool](https://containers.dev/supporting#tools) will composite
[the documented dev container properties](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/#devcontainer-feature-json-properties)
from the feature's `devcontainer-feature.json` file, and execute in the `install.sh` entrypoint
script in the container during build time. Implementing tools are also free to process attributes
under the `customizations` property as desired.

### Options

All available options for a Feature should be declared in the `devcontainer-feature.json`. The
syntax for the `options` property can be found in the
[devcontainer Feature json properties reference](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/#devcontainer-feature-json-properties).

Options are exported as Feature-scoped environment variables. The option name is capitalized and
sanitized according to
[option resolution](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/#option-resolution).

## Distributing Features

### Versioning

Features are individually versioned by the `version` attribute in a Feature's
`devcontainer-feature.json`. Features are versioned according to the semver specification. More
details can be found in
[the dev container Feature specification](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/#versioning).

### Publishing

> NOTE: The Distribution spec can be
> [found here](https://containers.dev/implementors/features-distribution/).
>
> While any registry
> [implementing the OCI Distribution spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec) can
> be used, this template will leverage GHCR (GitHub Container Registry) as the backing registry.

Features are meant to be easily sharable units of dev container configuration and installation code.

This repo contains a GitHub Action [workflow](.github/workflows/release.yaml) that will publish each
feature to GHCR. By default, each Feature will be prefixed with the `<owner/<repo>` namespace. For
example, the two Features in this repository can be referenced in a `devcontainer.json` with:

```
ghcr.io/trunk-io/devcontainer-feature/trunk:1
```

The provided GitHub Action will also publish a third "metadata" package with just the namespace, eg:
`ghcr.io/trunk-io/devcontainer-feature`. This contains information useful for tools aiding in
Feature discovery.

'`trunk-io/devcontainer-feature`' is known as the feature collection namespace.

### Marking Feature Public

Note that by default, GHCR packages are marked as `private`. To stay within the free tier, Features
need to be marked as `public`.

This can be done by navigating to the Feature's "package settings" page in GHCR, and setting the
visibility to 'public`. The URL may look something like:

```
https://github.com/users/<owner>/packages/container/<repo>%2F<featureName>/settings
```

### Adding Features to the Index

If you'd like your Features to appear in our [public index](https://containers.dev/features) so that
other community members can find them, you can do the following:

- Go to
  [github.com/devcontainers/devcontainers.github.io](https://github.com/devcontainers/devcontainers.github.io)
  - This is the GitHub repo backing the [containers.dev](https://containers.dev/) spec site
- Open a PR to modify the
  [collection-index.yml](https://github.com/devcontainers/devcontainers.github.io/blob/gh-pages/_data/collection-index.yml)
  file

This index is from where [supporting tools](https://containers.dev/supporting) like
[VS Code Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
and [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) surface Features for their dev
container creation UI.

#### Using private Features in Codespaces

For any Features hosted in GHCR that are kept private, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` access token in your
environment will need to have `package:read` and `contents:read` for the associated repository.

Many implementing tools use a broadly scoped access token and will work automatically. GitHub
Codespaces uses repo-scoped tokens, and therefore you'll need to add the permissions in
`devcontainer.json`

An example `devcontainer.json` can be found below.

```jsonc
{
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/my-org/private-features/hello:1": {
      "greeting": "Hello"
    }
  },
  "customizations": {
    "codespaces": {
      "repositories": {
        "my-org/private-features": {
          "permissions": {
            "packages": "read",
            "contents": "read"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
